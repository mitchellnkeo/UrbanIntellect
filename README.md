Seattle Urban Planning Assistant

NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2024
Challenge: Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements

A web-based decision support tool that helps urban planners make data-driven decisions about Seattle's sustainable growth by combining NASA Earth observation data with local datasets.

Overview
Over half of the global population lives in cities, and quality of life depends on balancing urban growth with environmental resilience. Seattle faces challenges from air quality, urban sprawl, population density, and climate-related risks like flooding and wildfire smoke.
Our tool bridges the gap between complex Earth observation data and actionable urban planning insights by:

Visualizing NASA satellite data and local datasets on an interactive map
Analyzing neighborhoods across multiple sustainability metrics
Recommending priority areas for intervention based on urban planning goals
Explaining AI-driven decisions in human-readable terms


Key Features:
Interactive Map Visualization

Seattle neighborhoods color-coded by priority score
Real-time data overlay from NASA and local sources
Click-to-explore neighborhood details

Goal-Based Recommendations
Select from urban planning objectives:

Increase Greenspace - Prioritize areas lacking parks and tree canopy
Improve Air Quality - Target neighborhoods with high pollution
Reduce Urban Heat - Identify heat-vulnerable areas
Equitable Development - Focus on underserved communities

AI-Powered Analysis

Weighted composite index algorithm
Explainable recommendations with reasoning
Specific action suggestions for each neighborhood
Transparent metric breakdown

Data-Driven Insights
Combines multiple data sources:

NASA Earthdata (air quality, land cover, temperature)
Copernicus Human Settlement Layer (urban sprawl)
WorldPop (population density)
Seattle Open Data (local context)
CDC Social Vulnerability Index

This app will be deployed to Vercel.
